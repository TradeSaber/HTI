# HTI
 Mini HTML to Image API created for TradeSaber

# Why?
 While working on TradeSaber, I couldn't find a reliable way to generate images from HTML in C#. I decided to look at web APIs that do the same and they either were queued or costly.
 To be fair in comparison ot the paid C# libraries the APIs were a lot better ($8000 vs $6 conservative on .NET vs API, $3000 vs $30 maximum)
